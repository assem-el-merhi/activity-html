    <p>The Wolf of Wall Street is a 2013 American biographical dark comedy film directed by <strong> Martin Scorsese</strong>. Based on a true story Leonardo DiCaprio plays <strong>Jordan Belfort</strong>, he founded the brokerage firm <em>Stratton Oakmont</em> which functioned as a boiler room marketing penny stocks, where he defrauded investors with fraudulent stock sales. During his years as a stock swindler, Belfort developed a hard-partying lifestyle, which included a serious drug addiction. Leonardo DiCaprio palying playing as Jordan was extremly facinating to see Leo act out as a broker thats addicted to sex, drug abuse, and scamming is bit overwhelming but he acted out every role with cofidence. His character gets to the end of this long movie having learned nothing, conceded nothing and even physically changed in no obvious way.</p>
    
    <p>The movie is entertainingly outrageous, and there's a shaggy-dog comic effect in seeing the same nightmare debauch over and over, although I don't think the coke'n'strippers war stories exactly constitute that critique of capitalism that some pundits have claimed for this film. Belfort impulsively hires his neighbour <strong>Donnie Azoff</strong>, played by <strong>Jonah Hill</strong>, a nerdy overweight guy with a weird cosmetic dental plate and Donnie becomes his beta-male wingman in the unending conquest of money and prostitutes. Belfort turns his operation into a glitzy firm and holds colossal trading-floor parties with dancing girls like a low-rent Charles Foster Kane. But when the Securities and Exchange Commission and the FBI start taking an interest, he needs to hide the cash through Swiss and British contacts that leads to every suspect in the scam behind bars.</p>
